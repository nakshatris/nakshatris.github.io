####Kubernetes
- Cluster: Its a system as a whole, comprising of many nodes pooling together their resources to form a powerful machine.  
  The cluster handles distribution of work across the nodes.
  
- Persistent volume: Programs running on a cluster arent guaranteed to run a particular node, data cant be saved on to the file system of any node. 
  If the program tries to save data and is then relocated to a different node, the data is not carried along. 
  Therefore, traditional local storage can only be used as a temporary cache to store programs. For permanent data, we need to attach persistent volume 
  (similar to plugging an external hard drive)
  
- Node: Core unit of kubernetes. It is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster.
  Each node is managed by a master and can host multiple pods. The master handles scheduling the pods across the nodes in a cluster.
  
- Pod: Wrapper for one or more containers which are run by K8s. Containers in the same pod will share the same resources. Containers within a pod can communicate with each other.
  It is a unit of replication for K8s. 
  Keeping pods as small as possible is useful for good resource utilisation, as pod replications leads to all containers inside scaling, which may not always be required. 
  It should typically hold the main process and its helper containers, known as **side-cars**
  
- Deployment: Even though pod is a basic unit of computation, it is managed inside one more layer of abstract called deployment. A deployment declares the number of replicas of a pod.
  When a pod inside a deployment dies, the deployment automatically re-creates a new pod. It declares the desired state of the system. Pods within a deployment can communicate using each other's IP without NAT. 
  
- Container: Programs running on pods are packaged as linux containers, allowing you to create self-contained linux execution environments. 
  Any program and its dependencies can be bundled up and shared on the internet. While multiple programs can be added into a single container, 
  it is best to stick with one process per container.
  
- Service: How does an external service know which IP address to connect to for the pods (because they could keep changes). Here's where service comes into picture.
  Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. Service allows the application to receive external traffic. 
  It can be used to easily expose an application deployed on a set of pods using a single endpoint. It can be of different types - ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
  
- Ingress: Once a cluster of nodes is created and deployments of pods are lauched onto the cluster, we now need to allow external traffic to the application. 
  Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies):

  - All pods can communicate with all other pods without NAT (network address translation)
  - All nodes running pods can communicate with all pods (and vice-versa) without NAT
  - IP that a pod sees itself as is the same IP that other pods see it as.

  However, by default, Kubernetes provides isolation between pods and the outside world. If you want to communicate with a K8s service, you need to open up a channel.  
  Ingress is not a type of service, but a collection of rules that acts as an entry point for the cluster, a step between the external world and the services.
  
  It can be confugured to give services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL / TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting.
  An Ingress controller, such as ingress-nginx, is needed to satisfy an Ingress. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect.

 ###Istio

Configurable, open source service mesh layer which can be used by developers to connect, monitor, secure networks of different microservices. 
Primarily run on kubernetes cluster, but can be used on any cluster software.
