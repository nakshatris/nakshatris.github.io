##### Terms
**ACH** - Stands for automated clearing house - a network that coordinates electronic payments and automated money transfers. 
Its a way to transfer money between bank accounts without the need for cheques, wire transfer, cash or credit card networks. 
They are usually processed in batches by the clearing house, making it cheaper and safer but could take 1-3 days. Each year ACH processes > 24b txns amounting to $41 trillion. 
Some examples of ACH include : direct deposit (salaries), business to vendor payments, bill payments. 
An ACH transfer takes place when a customer gives authorization to an originator in order to deposit or withdraw money directly from the customer's bank account.
Hence, an ACH-debit is also known as pre-authorized debit (PAD). 

**Wire transfer** - They are inter-bank transfers that are processed by the bank and no external clearing house network is involved, and hence are immediate. 
They generally cost the originator and receiver a charge. Only the sender can initiate a transfer.
