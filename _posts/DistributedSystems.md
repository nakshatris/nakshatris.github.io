  It includes the memory and resources needed for the program to operate, such as registers, counters, stack, heap and instructure (code)
  Register - Data holding palces part of CPU
  Counter - Instruction pointer, keeping track of where the computer is in the program sequence
  Stack - Data structure storing info on the active subroutines in the computer program, also known as scratch space for the process
  Heap - Dynamically allocated memory for the process.
  
* Thread - Unit of execution within a process. Process could be single threaded (process and thread are one and the same, and there is only one thing happening).
  Multi threaded processes have more than 1 thread working at the same time (well, almost same time).
